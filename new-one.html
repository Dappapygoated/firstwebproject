            Treaty 4, also known as the Qu'Appelle Treaty,
            is one of the numbered treaties negotiated between the Canadian government and Indigenous nations in the late 19th century. 
            It was signed on September 15, 1874, at Fort Qu'Appelle in what is now southern Saskatchewan. 
            The treaty covers a vast area that includes parts of present-day southern Saskatchewan, southwestern Manitoba,
            and a small portion of southeastern Alberta.
