    <h1><u>Who is this majestic man</u></h1>
    <p1>This website was made to inform you about Dapo and his beautiful world</p1>
    <p><strong>Dapo</strong> was born on a<em> crisp</em> sunny day, coincidence? i think not.<br>
        <strong>Dapos</strong> has lived his whole life like he was born, a constant sunshine and ray of hope to everyone he meets <br> Dapo moved to canada only 3 years befor he was able to make it to college, setting him back to grade 6
sad to think he could've been a doctor<br>
Throughout <strong>Dapo's </strong>life he has only one goal. To stay awesome, looks like he's doing a pretty redtastic job am i right?<br>
<strong>Dapo's </strong>favorite things include, leaving people on delivered, leaving them on read, leaving people hanging when they try to give him a high 5<br>
Act broke even tho he's balling and smiling :)<br>
<strong>Dapo </strong>only has one enemy, sadness and Dapo has won every battle. <br><strong>Dapo's </strong>favorite character, Hakari, has traits similar to him. Overall a very likable guy who acts impulsively<br>
instead of thinking things through, They both also has immensively lucky amounts of good luck<br>
might sound redundant but that is just how good they are. Lastly, they both have killer dance moves.</p>
